### contact
the best way to contact me is probably [signal](https://signal.org)
my number is +12096515325

the second is my email (i will add the public key when i make one)
epik (dot) draken (at) gmail (dot) com

i don't recommend gmail or other google services. i have another email address which i won't list publicly. i cannot yet delete my google account so i might as well make some use of it while i'm stuck with it.

as an absolute last-case scenario, i do have a skype for now, but i will be deleting it in the near future, will only share it through email, and do not recommend anyone use it, but it's an option (for now) if email and signal are too inconvient and skype is, for whatever reasons.
