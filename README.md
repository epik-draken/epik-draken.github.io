### contact
the best way to contact me is probably [signal](https://signal.org)
my number is +12096515325

the second is my email (i will add the public key when i make one)
epik (dot) draken (at) gmail (dot) com

i don't recomend gmail or other google services. i have another email address which i won't list publicly. i cannot yet delete my google account so i might as well make some use of it while i'm stuck with it.

### bookmarks
